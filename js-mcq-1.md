SOLUTION = Correct Answer(s):

JavaScript enables us create super cool animations!
JS enables us to interact with the website like dropdown menus, image sliders, modal windows, and more!

Here's why the other options are not accurate:

JavaScript is a significant tool for storing data globally so that we can access it from anywhere!
While JavaScript can store data, it's primarily for temporary storage within a web page's lifespan. For long-term, persistent data storage, databases or other server-side technologies are typically used.
JavaScript enables us to make our websites colorful and provide different styles!!  
This is the role of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), not JavaScript. JavaScript primarily handles interactive and dynamic behaviors on websites.

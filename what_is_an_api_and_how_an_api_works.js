**What is an API and How an API works**

Statement) What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. They act as intermediaries, enabling seamless integration and data sharing between different systems.

How an API Works?
To understand how an API works, let's consider an analogy.

Analogy: Ordering Food at a Restaurant
Imagine you are at a restaurant, and you want to order food from the menu. The restaurant's kitchen is like the back-end of an application, where all the data and processes are managed. The waiter or waitress who takes your order and delivers the food is like the API, facilitating communication between you (the client) and the kitchen (the server).

Steps in API Interaction:

Request: You (the client) interact with the API by making a request for specific information or functionality. In the restaurant analogy, this is when you order your food.

Processing the Request: The API receives the request and processes it. It determines what action needs to be taken based on the request. In the restaurant, the waiter or waitress takes note of your order.

Data Exchange: The API accesses the necessary data or performs the required actions to fulfill your request. In the restaurant, the waiter or waitress communicates your order to the kitchen.

Response: The API sends a response back to you (the client) with the requested information or action outcome. In the restaurant, this is when the food is served to your table.

APIs in Software Development
In the context of software development, APIs are used to enable different applications or services to interact with each other. They abstract the complexities of the underlying systems, allowing developers to access specific features or data without knowing the internal implementation.

Types of APIs
Web APIs (HTTP-based APIs): These are APIs that can be accessed over the internet using the HTTP protocol. Web APIs allow clients to communicate with web servers and access data or services.

Operating System APIs: Operating systems provide APIs that allow applications to interact with the underlying hardware and software services of the operating system.

Library APIs: Libraries in programming languages often come with APIs that provide pre-built functions and methods for developers to use in their applications.

MCQ
Here's a little MCQ to test your understanding.

We are working on a front end application, all the JavaScript we are writing are simple client side JS. What do you think will be the purpose of using an API in this Wordle Application?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOLUTION:- Correct Answer(s):

**Fetching Random Words:** Using an API to fetch random words ensures that the secret word for each game is different and unpredictable, enhancing the game's replayability.
**Validating User Guesses:** An API can be used to validate user guesses in real-time, providing instant feedback on whether the guess is correct or not.
**Providing Hints:** Integrating an API can allow the app to provide hints or synonyms for the secret word, helping the player progress in the game when they are stuck.
**Enhancing User Experience:** APIs can add dynamic content and interactions to the game, making it more engaging and enjoyable for the players.
Explanation:
Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct. 

APIs play a crucial role in front-end applications like Wordle, as they can open to us the following possibilities:
- fetching data, 
- validating user input, 
- providing hints, and 
- enhancing the overall user experience by adding dynamic features and functionalities to the game.

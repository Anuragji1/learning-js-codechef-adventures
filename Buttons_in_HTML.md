Buttons are commonly used to trigger actions or perform tasks in web applications. In HTML, buttons are created using the <button> tag. You can define the text or content of the button within the opening and closing tags of the <button> element.

For example, to create a button with the text "New Button" you can use the following HTML code:

<button>New Button</button>
You can also assign a class / id to the button using the following syntax

<button id="button1">New Button</button>

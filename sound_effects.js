**Sound Effects**

Statement) What are Sound Effects?
Sound effects are audio clips or recordings that are used to enhance the auditory experience in various forms of media, such as movies, video games, animations, and interactive applications. They are designed to mimic or create sounds that are realistic, dramatic, or engaging, adding depth and immersion to the overall experience. Sound effects can include anything from footsteps, explosions, and gunfire to background ambience, magical spells, and user interface interactions.

Why are Sound Effects Essential?
In the context of the Wordle game, sound effects play a crucial role in enhancing the gaming experience. For instance, the "start sound" that plays when the game begins creates a sense of anticipation and excitement, signaling the start of the challenge. When a player successfully guesses the correct word, the "success sound" reinforces a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction, adding to the emotional impact of winning. On the other hand, if the player runs out of chances, the "fail sound" might create tension or disappointment, prompting the player to try again. By incorporating these sound effects, the Wordle game becomes more immersive, captivating, and enjoyable, enriching the overall quality of the gaming experience.

In the upcoming problems, let us recap some fundamental concepts in Javascript programming.

We will begin by recapping data types and variables and understanding their roles in storing and manipulating data.
Next, we'll dive into if-else statements, a crucial control structure for making decisions in our code.
Loops will be introduced to help us iterate over code blocks efficiently.
Furthermore, we will explore arrays, which allow us to store multiple values in a single variable.

In the world of web development, HTML and CSS form the backbone of every web page.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the structure and content, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds the visual presentation and enhances the user experience.

When building web applications like a To-Do List app, it's crucial to establish a solid HTML/CSS backbone.
This backbone serves as the foundation upon which you'll add interactivity, functionality, and additional features.

In this module, we will delve into the essentials of building the HTML/CSS backbone for a To-Do List app.
We will mainly explore the fundamentals of HTML that you haven't learned in the past modules but is necessary to create the structure of the app!

Additionally, we will utilise CSS to style and layout the elements, ensuring an engaging and intuitive user interface.

The CSS cursor property allows you to specify the type of cursor to be displayed when hovering over an element. One common cursor style is the pointer cursor, which is used to indicate that an element is clickable or interactive.

To apply the pointer cursor to an element, you can use the following CSS code:

.element {
  cursor: pointer;
}
In this example, .element is the class name or selector of the HTML element you want to apply the pointer cursor to. When the user hovers over an element with this class, the cursor will change to the pointer shape, indicating that it can be clicked or interacted with.

The pointer cursor is commonly used for links, buttons, and other interactive elements to provide visual feedback and improve usability. By utilizing the pointer cursor appropriately throughout your web design, you can guide users and make it clear which elements are interactive.

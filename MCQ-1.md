Statement) MCQ-1) You want to create a unique div for containing the high-priority tasks, which of the following makes a perfect sense in terms of HTML code?
NOTE: A clean code is a good code! All the names you assign to a class or id should make perfect sense! Select one of the following options.



<div class="highPriorityContainer"></div> 


<div class="priorityContainer" id="highPriority"></div> 


<div id="containerHighPriority"></div> 


<div id="highPriorityContainer"></div> 

-----------------------------------------------------------
SOLUTION = The correct answer is <div id="highPriorityContainer"></div>.

Explanation:

Uniqueness: The id attribute is specifically designed to uniquely identify an element within a page. It's the appropriate choice for creating a unique container.
Meaningful Name: The name "highPriorityContainer" clearly conveys the purpose of the div, making the code more readable and maintainable.
Specificity: Using an id selector is more specific than a class selector, ensuring that styles or JavaScript targeting this element won't inadvertently affect other elements.
Why the other options are not optimal:

<div class="highPriorityContainer"></div>: While this option uses a descriptive class name, classes are meant for grouping elements, not unique identification. You could have multiple elements with this class, which might lead to conflicts.
<div class="priorityContainer" id="highPriority"></div>: This option combines a class and an id, but it's redundant. The id alone is sufficient to uniquely identify the element.
<div id="containerHighPriority"></div>: This option uses an id, but the name is less descriptive and could be confused with other container elements.
Therefore, <div id="highPriorityContainer"></div> is the most appropriate and efficient way to create a unique div for high-priority tasks, adhering to best practices in HTML code.
